# PRODIGY_WD_03
This repository contains my Tic Tac Toe Game created using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.<br>
The project includes Player vs Player, Player vs AI (Easy/Hard) modes, sound effects, and a persistent scoreboard.<br>

This task helped me understand game logic, DOM manipulation, AI implementation, and interactive UI design.<br>

🌟 Project Overview<br>
The Tic Tac Toe game is designed to be simple, modern, and interactive.<br>
It includes three gameplay modes and a clean UI with sound effects and score tracking.<br>
The Hard Mode uses the Minimax Algorithm, making the AI unbeatable.<br>

🎯 Objectives<br>
✔ Build an interactive browser-based game<br>
✔ Implement game logic using JavaScript<br>
✔ Add AI difficulty levels (Easy & Hard)<br>
✔ Save player scores using localStorage<br>
✔ Design a clean and responsive UI<br>
✔ Use sound effects for better user interaction<br>

🧩 Key Features<br>
🔹 1. Three Game Modes<br>
Player vs Player<br>
Player vs AI (Easy) — random moves<br>
Player vs AI (Hard) — Minimax algorithm<br>

🔹 2. Sound Effects<br>
Click sound for each move<br>
Victory sound on winning<br>
🔹 3. Scoreboard (Saved)<br>
Win counts for Player X, Player O, and Draws<br>
Automatically saved in browser localStorage<br>
🔹 4. Interactive UI<br>
Modern gradient background<br>
Clickable 3×3 grid<br>
Turn indicator<br>
Highlighted buttons and hover effects<br>
🔹 5. Responsive Layout<br>
Centered grid<br>
Mobile-friendly<br>
Smooth UI even on small screens<br>

🖥 Technologies Used<br>
Technology	Purpose<br>
HTML	Webpage structure<br>
CSS	Styling, layout, responsiveness<br>
JavaScript	Game logic, AI, scoreboard, sounds<br>

🧠 What I Learned<br>
While developing this game, I gained experience in:<br>
Implementing game logic using JavaScript<br>
Using DOM manipulation for interactivity<br>
Applying Minimax Algorithm for AI decision-making<br>
Working with localStorage for persistent data<br>
Writing cleaner, modular code<br>
Designing responsive layouts<br>
This project strengthened my logic-building and JavaScript problem-solving skills.<br>
